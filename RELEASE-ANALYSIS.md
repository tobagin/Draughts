- Release to Flathub Beta channel
- Gather user feedback
- Complete remaining features for 1.0.0

### Option B: 1.0.0 with Reduced Scope
- Remove incomplete features from UI (sound effects, drag-and-drop)
- Document as "planned features" for 1.1.0
- Focus on core gameplay stability
- Release minimal but polished product
- Add features in point releases

### Option C: Multiple Milestone Releases
- 0.5.0: Core gameplay + critical assets
- 0.7.0: Documentation + sound effects
- 0.9.0: Full testing + polish
- 1.0.0: Final stable release

**Recommended: Option A (Beta Release)** to get user feedback earlier

---

## 13. Conclusion

The Draughts application has a **solid technical foundation** with excellent architecture, modern GNOME integration, and comprehensive feature planning. However, it is **not ready for a 1.0.0 stable release** due to:

### Critical Gaps
1. Missing application icon (Flathub blocker)
2. No screenshots for AppStream metadata
3. Incomplete distribution packaging
4. Missing user documentation
5. Incomplete features (sound effects, PGN export)

### Strengths
1. Robust game engine with 16 variants
2. Modern GTK4/LibAdwaita UI
3. Strong accessibility foundation
4. Comprehensive settings system
5. Good internationalization framework

### Path Forward
**Recommend a phased approach:**
- **Immediate (4 weeks)**: Fix critical blockers → 0.5.0 Beta
- **Short-term (8 weeks)**: Complete documentation and testing → 0.9.0 RC
- **Medium-term (12 weeks)**: Final polish and release → 1.0.0 Stable

With focused effort on the identified gaps, this project can achieve a high-quality 1.0.0 release that meets GNOME standards and provides an excellent user experience.
