# Phase 0: Research & Technical Analysis

## Draughts Variants Analysis

### Decision: Support All 16 Specified Variants
**Rationale**: Based on clarification session, comprehensive coverage is required for international appeal and complete functionality.

**Variants to Implement**:
1. **Checkers/Anglo-American Draughts** (8x8 board, backward kings, no flying kings)
2. **Brazilian Draughts** (8x8 board, similar to International but different promotion rules)
3. **Italian Draughts** (8x8 board, men cannot capture kings, unique rules)
4. **Spanish Draughts** (8x8 board, backward capture allowed)
5. **Czech Draughts** (8x8 board, similar to International with variants)
6. **Thai Draughts** (8x8 board, unique capture sequences)
7. **German Draughts** (8x8 board, similar to International)
8. **Swedish Draughts** (8x8 board, variant rules)
9. **Russian Draughts** (8x8 board, flying kings, unique promotion)
10. **Pool Checkers** (8x8 board, American variant)
11. **Graeco-Turkish Draughts** (8x8 board, unique movement rules)
12. **Armenian Draughts** (8x8 board, traditional rules)
13. **Gothic Draughts** (8x8 board, historical variant)
14. **International Draughts** (10x10 board, flying kings, international standard)
15. **Frisian Draughts** (10x10 board, unique capture rules)
16. **Canadian Draughts** (12x12 board, largest variant)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Phased implementation (rejected - requirement for complete coverage)
- Focus on popular variants only (rejected - clarification specified all 16)

### Decision: Minimax AI with Alpha-Beta Pruning
**Rationale**: Industry standard for turn-based games, well-documented, achievable performance within 100ms constraint.

**Implementation Approach**:
- Base minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
- Configurable depth levels (1-15+ for difficulty progression)
- Position evaluation functions per variant
- Transposition tables for performance
- Iterative deepening for time management

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Monte Carlo Tree Search (rejected - complexity vs. benefit for draughts)
- Neural networks (rejected - training data requirements)
- Simple heuristic-based AI (rejected - insufficient challenge progression)

### Decision: Modular Rule Engine Architecture
**Rationale**: 16 variants require extensible system with shared components and variant-specific overrides.

**Architecture Components**:
- `IRuleEngine` interface for variant abstraction
- `BaseRuleEngine` with common functionality
- Variant-specific implementations inheriting from base
- `MoveValidator` for move legality checking
- `BoardState` for position representation
- `GameController` for game flow management

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single monolithic rule engine (rejected - maintainability issues)
- Configuration-driven rules (rejected - insufficient flexibility for unique variants)

## AI Difficulty Implementation

### Decision: Progressive Depth + Evaluation Tuning
**Rationale**: Provides smooth difficulty curve with meaningful progression from beginner to expert level.

**Difficulty Levels (7+ levels)**:
1. **Beginner**: Depth 1, simple piece count evaluation
2. **Easy**: Depth 2, basic positional evaluation
3. **Novice**: Depth 3, improved position weights
4. **Intermediate**: Depth 4, mobility considerations
5. **Advanced**: Depth 5, king safety evaluation
6. **Expert**: Depth 6, advanced positional features
7. **Master**: Depth 7+, full evaluation function
8. **Grandmaster**: Depth 8+, opening book integration

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Random move selection for easy levels (rejected - not educational)
- Static evaluation differences only (rejected - insufficient progression)

## Timing Controls Research

### Decision: Comprehensive Tournament System
**Rationale**: Clarification specified both classical and Fischer increment support for tournament play.

**Timing Modes**:
- **Untimed**: No time constraints
- **Blitz**: 3+0, 3+2, 5+0 configurations
- **Rapid**: 10+0, 15+10, 25+10 configurations
- **Classical**: 60+30, 90+30, 120+30 configurations
- **Fischer**: Base time + increment per move
- **Custom**: User-configurable base time and increment

**Implementation**:
- Per-player timer tracking
- Pause/resume functionality
- Audio/visual time warnings
- Automatic game termination on timeout
- Time display in various formats (MM:SS, H:MM:SS)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Basic countdown only (rejected - insufficient for tournament play)
- Fixed time controls only (rejected - flexibility requirement)

## Performance Optimization Research

### Decision: Bitboard Representation + Move Generation
**Rationale**: Required for <100ms move calculation constraint across all variants.

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Bitboard representation for 8x8, 10x10, 12x12 boards
- Precomputed move tables for piece types
- Efficient capture detection algorithms
- Move ordering for alpha-beta effectiveness
- Transposition table with Zobrist hashing

**Benchmarking Targets**:
- Move generation: <10ms for any position
- Position evaluation: <1ms per position
- AI move selection: <100ms at competitive depths
- UI updates: 60fps during animations

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Array-based representation (rejected - performance insufficient)
- On-demand move calculation (rejected - latency issues)

## GTK4/LibAdwaita Integration

### Decision: Custom Drawing Area + AdwPreferencesWindow
**Rationale**: Game board requires custom rendering, preferences use standard GNOME patterns.

**UI Components**:
- `DraughtsBoard` (custom GTK.DrawingArea)
- `GameControls` (AdwActionRow-based timing/controls)
- `VariantSelector` (AdwComboRow)
- `AISettings` (AdwPreferencesWindow)
- `GameHistory` (AdwExpanderRow with move list)

**Accessibility Features**:
- Full keyboard navigation (arrow keys, space/enter selection)
- Screen reader announcements (position descriptions, move feedback)
- High contrast support (automatic theme adaptation)
- Configurable piece highlighting

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Grid-based board layout (rejected - inflexible for different board sizes)
- External game board widget (rejected - custom requirements)

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: Three-Tier Testing Approach
**Rationale**: Game logic complexity requires comprehensive validation at multiple levels.

**Test Levels**:
1. **Unit Tests**: Rule engines, move validation, AI evaluation
2. **Integration Tests**: Game flow, timing controls, persistence
3. **Accessibility Tests**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility

**Test Coverage Goals**:
- 100% coverage for rule engine implementations
- All 16 variants validated against standard positions
- Performance regression testing for AI algorithms
- Accessibility compliance verification

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Manual testing only (rejected - insufficient for 16 variants)
- Automated UI testing only (rejected - game logic complexity)

## GSettings Schema Design

### Decision: Hierarchical Preference Structure
**Rationale**: Organized settings for game preferences, AI configuration, and accessibility options.

**Schema Structure**:
```

│   ├── default-variant (enum)
│   ├── show-legal-moves (boolean)
│   ├── animation-speed (enum)
