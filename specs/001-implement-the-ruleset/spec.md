# Feature Specification: Implement the Ruleset for Each Type of Draughts Game

**Feature Branch**: `001-implement-the-ruleset`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "implement the ruleset for each type of draughts game."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Feature requires implementing game rules for multiple draughts variants
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: Players (human/AI), Game Engine
   � Actions: Move pieces, capture, promote, validate moves
   � Data: Game state, piece positions, rules per variant
   � Constraints: Valid moves per ruleset, winning conditions
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Rulesets: Checkers/Anglo-American Draughts, Brazilian Draughts, Italian Draughts, Spanish Draughts, Czech Draughts, Thai Draughts, German Draughts, Swedish Draughts, Russian Draughts, Pool Checkers, Graeco-Turkish Draughts, Armenian Draughts, Gothic Draughts, International Draughts, Frisian Draughts and Canadian Draughts.
   � Ai Difficulty: Yes, AI difficulty levels should be configurable!
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Players can start games with different rule variants
   � System enforces rules and validates moves automatically
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement focuses on game rule enforcement
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Game variants, pieces, board states, moves
7. Run Review Checklist
   � Spec ready for planning phase
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-23
- Q: For the initial release scope, which draughts variants should be prioritized? → A: All 16 variants mentioned in execution flow
- Q: For AI difficulty levels, how many distinct difficulty settings should the system provide? → A: 7+ levels: Fine-grained progression
- Q: For game timing controls, which timing modes should be supported? → A: Both C and D (all timing features)
- Q: For move history and game replay, what level of functionality is required? → A: Basic: Undo last move only
- Q: For draw conditions, how should repetition draws be determined? → A: Variant-specific rules (differs per game type)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A player opens the draughts application and selects their preferred game variant (International, American, Russian, etc.). The system enforces the specific rules of that variant, automatically validating moves, handling captures, and determining win conditions according to the chosen ruleset.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new game is started with International Draughts rules, **When** a player attempts to move a man piece backwards, **Then** the system rejects the move as invalid
2. **Given** a piece reaches the opposite end of the board, **When** the move is completed, **Then** the system automatically promotes the piece to a king according to the variant's promotion rules
3. **Given** a capture sequence is available, **When** a player tries to make a non-capturing move, **Then** the system enforces mandatory capture rules if required by the selected variant
4. **Given** multiple capture paths exist, **When** a player must choose one, **Then** the system applies the variant's priority rules (longest sequence, most pieces, etc.)
5. **Given** a game reaches an endgame state, **When** win/draw conditions are met, **Then** the system correctly identifies and declares the game result

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a player runs out of legal moves but still has pieces on the board?
- How does the system handle stalemate conditions that vary between rule variants?
- What occurs when capture sequences create loops or complex multi-jump scenarios?
- How are draw conditions determined (piece count, move repetition, time limits)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support multiple draughts game variants with distinct rulesets
- **FR-002**: System MUST enforce movement rules specific to each variant (diagonal only, piece types, direction restrictions)
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate capture rules including mandatory captures, capture sequences, and multiple jumps
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement promotion rules when pieces reach the opposite end of the board
- **FR-005**: System MUST detect and enforce win conditions (no legal moves, no pieces remaining, resignation)
- **FR-006**: System MUST detect draw conditions (stalemate, repetition, insufficient material)
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle king piece movement and capture rules distinct from regular pieces
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate that players can only move their own pieces during their turn
- **FR-009**: System MUST prevent illegal moves and provide appropriate feedback to players
- **FR-010**: System MUST support all 16 draughts variants: Checkers/Anglo-American, Brazilian, Italian, Spanish, Czech, Thai, German, Swedish, Russian, Pool Checkers, Graeco-Turkish, Armenian, Gothic, International, Frisian, and Canadian Draughts
- **FR-011**: System MUST support comprehensive timing controls including blitz, rapid, classical modes and Fischer increment with tournament time controls
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide basic undo functionality allowing players to undo their last move
- **FR-013**: System MUST implement 7+ configurable AI difficulty levels providing fine-grained progression from beginner to expert
- **FR-014**: System MUST apply variant-specific draw conditions including repetition rules that differ per game type

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Game Variant**: Represents different draughts rulesets with specific movement, capture, and win condition rules (16 variants total)
- **Game Board**: 8x8 or 10x10 grid depending on variant, tracks piece positions and valid squares
- **Game Piece**: Individual checkers with properties (color, type, position, promotion status)
- **Game State**: Current board position, active player, available moves, game status, move history (last move for undo)
- **Move**: Represents a player action including start/end positions, captured pieces, and rule validation
- **Ruleset Engine**: Validates moves and enforces variant-specific game rules including draw conditions
- **AI Player**: Computer opponent with 7+ configurable difficulty levels
- **Timer**: Game timing controls supporting multiple modes (blitz, rapid, classical, Fischer increment)
